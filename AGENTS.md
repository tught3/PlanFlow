# AGENTS.md for `E:\FluxStudio\PlanFlow`

This file is the top-priority working rule for this repo.
Secondary detail sources: `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/agent-rules-*.md`.

## Default language
- Always respond in Korean.

## Default operating order
1. If a request has 2 or more issues, or spans multiple subsystems, plan first with the strongest planner available.
2. Use the plan to execute with worker agents, preferably in parallel when file scopes do not overlap.
3. Always run a separate review/verifier pass after implementation.
4. If review finds anything incomplete or risky, fix it and review again.
5. Only report completion when nothing is left to change.

## Model routing
- Planning: `gpt-5.5`
- Execution: `gpt-5.4-mini`
- Review / verification: `gpt-5.4-mini`
- If a task benefits from GSD, use GSD first and keep the same model split inside that workflow.

## Workflow rules
- Every task must begin with context hygiene: check `.planning/STATE.md`, check `.planning/context/ACTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, and run `node scripts/gsd-context-hygiene.mjs` when it exists. If the script is missing, explicitly record that it is missing and continue.
- Every completed task/logical change must end with verification, a planning-context checkpoint, a Git commit, and a push to the remote repository.
- Every completed task/logical change must also end with a fresh build and, when the target device is available, a real run/launch check before reporting completion.
- For any Flutter run/build/test command in this repo, prefer `scripts/flutter-local.ps1` so `env/local.json` and the local `--dart-define` set are injected automatically. Do not fall back to raw `flutter` unless the wrapper is missing or the user explicitly asks.
- Before starting work, check `.planning/STATE.md` and `.planning/context/ACTIVE_SUMMARY.md`.
- Run `node scripts/gsd-context-hygiene.mjs` at session start, before long work, and before final report. If the script is missing, record that and continue.
- After every completed logical change, update `.planning/context/ACTIVE_SUMMARY.md` with a short checkpoint.
- After every completed logical change, commit and push to the remote repository.
- Do not leave unused helper terminals or sessions open; close them when they are no longer needed.
- Do not commit unrelated or user-created untracked files unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer existing code, shared helpers, and existing docs before creating new structures.
- Create new code only when reuse is clearly worse.
- Do not delete unused code until implementation and verification are fully complete.
- For complex work, split into independent subagent tasks and run them in parallel when safe.
- When code changes are needed, prefer worker agents for implementation and a separate reviewer for verification.
- Completed worker/reviewer agents must be closed unless there is a specific reuse plan.
- Keep direct edits narrow; use them only for trivial fixes or repo settings/doc updates.
- If a request has 2 or more issues, the plan-review-implement-review loop is mandatory by default.
- Do not ask for permission between intermediate steps in the same batch unless a real decision is blocked.
- Answer all user questions that appear in the same request, even if they are separate from the code task.
- Do not modify tests unless the task explicitly asks for test changes or the implementation requires test updates.
- Keep the scope tight; do not add unrelated changes, and report known gaps instead.

## Repo-specific rules
- Work from `E:\FluxStudio\PlanFlow` unless the user explicitly changes the working path.
- `E:\Project\PlanFlow` is a read-only reference source for files that previously worked, especially login and app flow.
- `G:\AI-automatic-expense-tracker` is reference-only and must not be modified.
- `lite-app/` is read-only for this work; do not modify it.
- PlanFlow product scope is defined by `PlanFlow_Codex_Prompt_v3.md`.
- Supabase schema source of truth is `supabase/schema.sql`.
- For 1st release, do not implement billing, ads, reward ads, Kakao/SMS/call detection, or TEAM/BUSINESS features.
- Naver Calendar is now a 1st-release working feature. Keep OAuth consent, token handling, and calendar export behavior visible and testable.
- Keep all user-facing UI text Korean unless a platform/provider brand requires otherwise.
- If Korean text appears broken/mojibake in terminal output, re-read the file or output explicitly as UTF-8 before interpreting or editing it. Do not make decisions from broken Korean text.
- Voice files must never be sent to external servers. Only STT text may be stored or sent for parsing.
- `speech_to_text` must use `SpeechListenOptions(onDevice: true)` for STT.
- If ADB screenshots or mirroring are black, ask the user to turn on the phone screen before visual verification.
- Keep the PlanFlow Home UI close to the compact card-based reference: clean Korean schedule cards, no large blank first viewport.
